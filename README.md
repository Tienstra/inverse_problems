# Inverse problems in imaging - project
Image denoising and image deblurring are classical ill-pose inverse problems. A unique solution exists but this solution is often not continuously dependant on the noise level. we can resolve this ill-posedness by introducing regularization of the reconstructions. We know that common methods are able to produce stable reconstruction but are interested in performance of a convolutional denoising auto-encoder in such tasks, as we have seen other deep learning methods outperform the more regular methods. In particular we would like to explore if convolutional denoising auto-encoder give stable reconstructions, as this is not a guarantee. We review and test common algorithms in as denoising/deblurring algorithms on the grey scaled MNIST data set, and will compare their reconstruction to the convolutional denoising auto-encoder using the peak signal-to-noise ratio,PSNR, and structural similarity index measure, SSIM, as measures of how good the reconstructions are.
